# React Hooks
- A react hook is a normal javascript function which is given to us by react the only difference is that this is a utility function given by react to us.

There are 2 important hooks-
- useState()
- useEffect()



- useState() -  It is used to gave superpowerful state variables in react.

    - why it is called state variable?
      The useState is called the state variable because it mantain the state of your components.

Local State Variable - Super powerful variable 
const[listOfRestaurants] = useState([]);

Normal JS Variable
let listOfRestaurants = [];




Render:- whenever a state variable is update react re- render the component
